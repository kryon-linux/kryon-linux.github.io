# KryonOS

**The power of Arch. The ease of Debian. Built for everyone.**

So yeah, i was so bored that i started creating this project like a 2 years ago or so, but it turns out making linux via LFS is not the best idea.
So i deleted all my progress just to start fresh and fork arch linux, and here i am writing this wiki.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

If you are already on this github page i can asume that your know at least something about installing systems,
but if you dont just go to our site and download the auto-installer program.

but if i was right and you know what you're doing follow this steps:

1. **Download** the latest ISO from the [Releases](https://github.com/kryon-linux/kryon-linux/releases) page.
2. **Flash it** to a USB drive using tools like Balena Etcher or Rufus.
3. **Boot** from the USB.
4. **Launch the installer** and follow the step-by-step instructions.

_Advanced users can switch to TTY2 and do it the Arch way if they want, but it‚Äôs not recommended due to potential bugs in our Kryman tool._

## üì¶ Default Software

- Desktop Environment: We support xfce4, kde plasma, gnome and Hyprland but you can still download some manually via our installer.
- Package Managment: I mean, Kryon uses mainly officiall repo's and AUR but ofc if you want our software center supports flatpak ass well
- Software Center: [We are curently working on something big but for now you need to stick with kryman tool.]
