# KryonOS

**The power of Arch. The ease of Debian. Built for everyone.**

So yeah, i was so bored that i started creating this project like a 2 years ago or so, but it turns out making linux via LFS is not the best idea.
So i deleted all my progress just to start fresh and fork arch linux, and here i am writing this wiki.

## 📦 Default Software

- Desktop Environment: We support xfce4, kde plasma, gnome and Hyprland but you can still download some manually via our installer.
- Package Managment: I mean, Kryon uses mainly officiall repo's and AUR but ofc if you want our software center supports flatpak ass well
- Software Center: [We are curently working on something big but for now you need to stick with kryman tool.]
Everything else is up to you – it’s your system, your rules.
